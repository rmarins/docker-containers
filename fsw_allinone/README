JBoss FSW Cluster All-in-One Container
======================================

By using this Dockerfile you'll build a FSW cluster in a single container.

Drop the required files in the ./software directory and build it running the ./install.sh .

Run by using the ./start.sh and it will print the container IP address when finished.

Get access to JBoss FSW admin console using:

  - Node 1: http://<container-ip>:9990/ - user: admin / pswd: redhat@2
  - Node 2: http://<container-ip>:10990/ - user: admin / pswd: redhat@2

Or try the mod_cluster manager console acessing:

  - http://<container-ip>/mod_cluster_manager

Services must be deployed on both Nodes for experiencing the HA features.
